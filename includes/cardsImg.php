                    <p class="card-text navyCardText mb-5">Despite advances and improvements in the treatment of cancer, there is still a long way to go and this is why cancer research is so important. Research is the only way to ensure that new and better cancer treatments and drugs continue to become available for people with cancer.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText mb-5">The evidence also clearly shows that cancer patients treated in research-active hospitals have better outcomes than those who are not. This is why, as part of NECRET’s mission we believe it is important to help support vital clinical cancer research.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample001">Our Lady of Lourdes and Beaumont Hospitals are both sister hospitals within the RSCI Hospital Group that work together in delivering patient care. Members of the NECRET board recently visited the RCSI Oncology Lab on the Beaumont campus, where the research is conducted to receive an update on the very latest developments the charity supports; including approaches to improve the treatment of bowel and lung cancers.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample001">NECRET would like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who has supported its cause and without whom these advances wouldn’t be possible.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample001">The charity is proud to have supported advances across different cancer types including lung, ovarian, breast and bowel which can viewed at <a href="cuttingEdge.php">https://www.necret.ie/cuttingEdge</a></p>

                    <p class="card-text navyCardText mt-2 mb-5">NECRET are very proud and excited to have played a significant role in contributing towards a significant development in lung cancer diagnosis. This new test which was advanced in collaboration by Dr Rob Smyth under Professor Bryan Hennessy will mean that some cases of lung cancer will be able to be monitored from microscopic breath particles. Lung cancer is the cause of approximately a fifth of all cancer deaths in Ireland and unfortunately the number of cases continues to increase by 3% annually.</p>
