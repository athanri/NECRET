                    Cancer awareness of signs and symptoms regardless of age will always be important.
                    If you have concerns or are worried about symptoms always contact your GP. If you notice a change in how you feel or how your body works, it is better to be safe and get it checked.

                    <p class="card-text navyCardText mt-2 mb-5">NECRET are very proud and excited to have played a significant role in contributing towards a significant development in lung cancer diagnosis. This new test which was advanced in collaboration by Dr Rob Smyth under Professor Bryan Hennessy will mean that some cases of lung cancer will be able to be monitored from microscopic breath particles. Lung cancer is the cause of approximately a fifth of all cancer deaths in Ireland and unfortunately the number of cases continues to increase by 3% annually.</p>
