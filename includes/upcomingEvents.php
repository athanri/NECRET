                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Boyne Valley Camino Challenge Registration Open Interested in a fun challenge of an amazing 25km walk and ramble through the beautiful Boyne Valley countryside in aid of NECRET, who support focused activities towards improving treatment and outcomes of people with cancer.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Starting from St Peter’s Church led by wonderfully experienced tour leaders who have very kindly volunteered their services, the trail follows the River Boyne before gaining the woodlands of the Townley Estate and then meandering quiet lanes to Mellifont, where there will be an opportunity for that much earned packed lunch or other refreshments. A separate return route gives a total walk of 25km.</p>
