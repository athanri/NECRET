                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Many of these including our own Annual walk in memory of Celine Reilly Flynn has had to be canceled.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Cancer research relies on fundraising and with this in mind we decided to organize a virtual walk to take place between Christmas Eve and New Years Eve.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">We encourage you to take the time at your leisure to walk with your family to remember those we lost and those still battling cancer. Please donate by clicking the link. So letâ€™s have fun while doing this, grab your Santa Hat</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">upload your photo and we will create a video to remember the walk and say goodbye to 2020... All proceeds go to NECRET, (North East Cancer Research Educational Trust)</p>

                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample0">"There aren't many families in Ireland that haven't been affected by cancer and 2020 in particular has been a very difficult year for both charities and families alike.
                    Necret is a charity set up to raise funds for equipment, cancer research and training at the North East Oncology Unit based in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.
                    I normally participate in Necret's largest annual fundraiser in the north-east - the Dip in the Nip. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 restrictions, this year's event was cancelled.
                    To co-inside with the Winter Solstice, I will be shaving my head for charity at dawn on 21st December 2020, which will be streamed live on my Facebook page.
                    Christmas can be a demanding time of year financially. But if you could please dig deep and sponsor me if you can, I would be very appreciative.
                    Thank you, Sandra."</p>
