                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">2020 has been a very challenging year for everyone. Charities have really been affected by COVID-19.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Many of these including our own Annual walk in memory of Celine Reilly Flynn has had to be canceled.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Cancer research relies on fundraising and with this in mind we decided to organize a virtual walk to take place between Christmas Eve and New Years Eve.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">We encourage you to take the time at your leisure to walk with your family to remember those we lost and those still battling cancer. Please donate by clicking the link. So let’s have fun while doing this, grab your Santa Hat</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">upload your photo and we will create a video to remember the walk and say goodbye to 2020... All proceeds go to NECRET, (North East Cancer Research Educational Trust)</p>
