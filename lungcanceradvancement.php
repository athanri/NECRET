                        <p>NECRET are very proud and excited to have played a significant role in contributing towards a 
                            significant development in lung cancer diagnosis. This new test which was advanced in 
                            collaboration by Dr Rob Smyth under Professor Bryan Hennessy will mean that some cases of 
                            lung cancer will be able to be monitored from microscopic breath particles. Lung cancer is 
                            the cause of approximately a fifth of all cancer deaths in Ireland and unfortunately the 
                            number of cases continues to increase by 3% annually.</p>
                        <p>As with the introduction of any new drug treatment for cancer or other diseases, this new 
                            approach will go through the strictly monitored Clinical Trial Process. With encouraging results 
                            to date it will begin the final part of the process which is Phase 3 shortly, when it will be 
                            open to patients from across Ireland and in locations Internationally. (more details at bottom)</p>
                        <p>NECRET have also funded research that has realized advances in other cancer types such as 
                            breast, bowel and stomach cancer. With these studies recognised and receiving prestigious 
                            awards from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and European Journal of 
                            Medical Oncology (ESMO).</p>
                        <p>In its fight against cancer NECRET aims to deliver the highest quality cutting edge care and 
                            treatment for patients through a number of activities. In addition to clinical cancer 
                            research into new treatment methodologies and approaches mentioned above, it uses funds to 
                            enhance the support and care provided to cancer patients by the unit to make their stay as 
                            comfortable as possible. The other activities are educating and training its nurses 
                            and medical staff so they can use all new techniques as they are introduced so as to be in 
                            a position to offer tailored treatments to all cancer patients along with purchasing of 
                            equipment that is vital to the delivery of quality patient care.</p>
                        <p>Professor Bryan Hennessy would like to take the opportunity to express his 
                            heartfelt thanks and appreciation to everybody who contributes and supports NECRET in its Mission. 
                            With the generosity of the public and all those who organise fundraising events, our Necret 
                            volunteers and the local businesses and sponsors, who together make a big difference in our 
                            fight against cancer.</p>
                        <h3>A Breath Test supporting Global Access to Care</h3>
                        <p>This breakthrough approach means a number of potential patient benefits
                            including it being non-invasive versus standard tissue biopsies where a
                            sample (s) of the tumour are taken which can cause complications like
                            collapsed lungs. As the fight against cancer moves towards increasingly
                            personalised patient treatments, “liquid biopsies” where a sample of blood
                            or another type of fluid sample is used to not only detect lung cancer and
                            reveal if treatment methods are working, but also for genetic testing. This
                            testing can help determine if a patient might benefit from targeted more
                            precise therapies or immunotherapy treatments. This lung cancer
                            diagnostic which we helped fund comes under this umbrella by adding
                            another important tool for cancer doctors.</p>
                        <p>The goal is an operational method to identify and monitor lung cancer that
                            is non-invasive, accurate, inexpensive and widely accessible. The latter two
                            are key for Lesser Developed Countries (LDCs) where access to affordable
                            quality care is difficult. “We hope these developments will lead to providing
                            more people across the world with more information about their cancer and
                            thus better treatment options and lives saved” – Dr Smyth.</p>
                        <h3>Just Ask Your Doctor</h3>
                        <p>Thousands of people in Ireland are taking part in cancer trials. People with
                            cancer who would like to know more about whether there is a cancer trial
                            suitable for them are encouraged to ask their doctor if there’s a cancer trial
                            that may be suitable for them. Potential questions that may be relevant can
