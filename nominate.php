                        <p>Does your workplace nominate a ‘Charity of Choice’ every year? If so, we would be delighted to be considered as your Charity of the Year. We can work with your Charity Committee to help you develop a programme of fundraising for the year ahead.</p>

                        <p>Without sponsorship, we would not be able to run certain events, which would directly reduce the funds we have available to support our ongoing research programmes. Sponsoring a NECRET event can work in many ways, and bring a wide range of benefits, including increasing brand awareness, generating positive PR for your company, motivating your staff, and showing commitment to your local community.</p>

                        <h3>Employee Payroll Giving</h3>
                        <p>Payroll giving encourages members of staff to give regularly through their salaries. It’s very simple: staff members decide how much they wish to donate and these voluntary donations are deducted from the company payroll.</p>

                        <h3>Corporate Donation</h3>
                        <p>NECRET greatly appreciates donations from companies. These donations help us to continue our work of supporting pioneering research nationally. The tax benefits to you as a company are an added bonus. If a company makes a donation of €250 or more to NECRET, the company can claim a deduction for the donation as if it were a trading expense.</p>

                        <h3>Matched Giving</h3>
                        <p>Matched giving is where an employer matches the amount an employee has raised or donated. Matched-giving by companies boosts the morale of employee fundraisers/donors, as it shows them you are supporting what they do. Employers can match one-off gifts by an individual or match the total money raised from employee fundraising efforts.</p>
