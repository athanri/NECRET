                        <p>Each year in Ireland many young people fundraise for charity through schools, colleges, universities or youth organisations. Some benefits of getting involved with a charitable cause is the building of confidence and self-esteem, the learning of new skills and the gaining of valuable experience and points towards initiatives such as GAISC the President&#39;s Award.</p>
                        <p>Each year NECRET runs its School Open Day where students from transition year and senior cycle interested in becoming a possible future career in medicine can hear about life as an Oncology Doctor, Nurse or Research Scientist.</p>
                        <p>If you are a young person seeking a fundraising opportunity, please get in touch. Many youngsters in the North East have helped by promoting us as their class charity, holding bake sales or other fundraising events for us, or raising money for us through dress down days or sports days - and we greatly appreciate all of their fantastic work!</p>
