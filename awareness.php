                            <p>If you’re in a certain age or population group, you can also have screening tests that help find bowel, breast and cervical and cancer before you’ve even noticed symptoms.</p>
                            <p>Take control of your health – see your GP on a regular basis and know when you should be screened for certain cancers.</p>
                            <p>A screening test is designed for populations of individuals who do not have any symptoms of disease. It aims to identify those with a risk marker for a disease and ensure early treatment.</p>

                            <p>If you notice any signs or symptoms that you're concerned about please contact your GP. Early detection remains key. The earlier cancer is found, the more likely it is to be cured.</p>
                            <p>There are certain symptoms you should always have checked. There are many different symptoms of cancer. Common symptoms include:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group pb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item">Unexplained Bleeding</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item">Unexplained Weight Loss</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item">A Lump or Swelling</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item">Unexplained Pain</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item">Constantly Tired</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item">Changes on your skin</li>
                             </ul>
                            <p>These symptoms can be caused by something other than cancer. But it’s always best to have them checked by your GP as soon as possible. It is never a waste of their time.</p>
