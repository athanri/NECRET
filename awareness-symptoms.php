                        <h4 class=awareness>Know your body</h4>
                        <p>If you know your body and what is normal for you, it will help you to be aware of any changes. People sometimes think a change in their body isn’t worth bothering their GP about. Or they may feel embarrassed talking about it.</p>
                        <p>But if you notice a change in how you feel or how your body works, it is better to be safe and get it checked.</p>
                        <p>Always see your GP if you have symptoms that are ongoing, unexplained or unusual for you.</p>
                        <h4 class=awareness>Ongoing symptoms</h4>
                        <p>If you have a symptom that lasts for more than three weeks, see your GP.
                        This might be a cough that doesn’t go away, a change in bowel habits, a
                        mouth ulcer that doesn’t heal or feeling bloated most days.</p>
                        <h4 class=awareness>Unexplained symptoms</h4>
                        <p>This means a symptom that doesn’t have an obvious cause. For example,
                        having a lump or bleeding without any injury.</p>
                        <h4 class=awareness>Symptoms that are unusual for you</h4>
                        <p>This means a change in your body that is not normal for you. It could be a
                        change in a cough you have had for a long time, a change to a mole, new
                        unexplained bleeding or a change in the skin on your breast.</p>
                        <p>Having any of these symptoms does not usually mean you have cancer,
                        but it is sensible to speak to your GP. The cause of the symptoms is
                        probably nothing to worry about, but it could be a sign of something that
                        needs treatment.</p>
                        <p>If it is cancer, the sooner it is found, the more likely it is to be cured. And if
                        it’s nothing serious, your GP can tell you not to worry.</p>
                        <p>If you have already been to your GP but the symptoms haven’t gone away,
                        it is important to see them again in a week or so. Any unexplained bleeding
                        is a sign that something might be wrong. You should always get this
                        checked by your GP.</p>

                            <p>Bladder and kidney cancers are more common in men and people over 50, but can affect
                            people of any gender or age.</p>
                            <p>See your GP if you have any of these symptoms:</p>

                            <p>Bowel cancer is one of the more common cancers in Ireland. It can affect both men and
                            women. Most people who get bowel cancer are over 50, but it can happen at any age.</p>
                            <p>See your GP if you have any of these symptoms:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group pb-2">

                            <p>These symptoms can be caused by other things. Most people with these symptoms do not
                            have bowel cancer. But if you have any of them, it is important to see your doctor. If you
                            develop symptoms after a normal bowel screening test, you should still get them checked by
                            your GP.</p>

                            <p>Breast cancer is cancer that starts in the breast tissue. It is more common in women over
                            50, and nearly half of breast cancers develop in women over 65, but it can happen at any
                            age. Men can also get breast cancer, but this is rare.</p>
                            <p>Get to know how your breasts look and feel. If there are changes, this will help you spot
                            them early.</p>
                            <p>See your GP if you have any of these symptoms:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group pb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">a new lump or an area that feels denser in your breast or armpit</li>

                            <p>Most breast changes are not caused by cancer. But if you notice any changes or
                            symptoms, it is important to see your GP. If you would prefer to see a female doctor, your
                            GP surgery should be able to arrange this for you.</p>

                            <p>Cervical cancer develops in a woman’s cervix, which is the opening to the uterus at the top
                            of the vagina. It occurs when cells in the cervix become abnormal and grow at an
                            uncontrolled rate.</p>
                            <p>Early-stage cervical cancer may have no symptoms. This is why it is important to go for your
                            regular cervical screening, so that any early cell changes can be picked up.</p>
                            <p>See your GP if you have any of these symptoms:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group pb-2">

                            </ul>
                            <p>If you are going to your GP surgery for regular screening, let them know if you develop any
                            of these symptoms between screenings. You may feel embarrassed talking about these
                            symptoms, but your GP or practice nurse will see many women with similar symptoms. They
                            will do their best to put you at ease.</p>
                            <p>There are many other conditions that can cause these symptoms. But if you have any

                            over 60.</p>

                            <p>People with fair skin that freckles and burns in the sun are at a higher risk of getting a type of
                            skin cancer called melanoma. You can reduce your risk by using a high-factor sun cream (at

                            <p>About half of all melanomas are found in people over 65, but it can happen at any age. It is

                            <p>Mouth and throat cancer is more common in men and people over 65, but can happen at
                            any age. The main risk factors are smoking and drinking alcohol. Another risk factor is
                            infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV).</p>

                            <p>Ovarian cancer is more common in women over 50, but it can affect women of any age. If
                            two or more of your close relatives have had ovarian or breast cancer, you may be at a
                            higher risk. Your close relatives include your mother, sisters or daughters.</p>
                            <p>The symptoms of ovarian cancer can often be vague. See your GP if you have any of these
                            symptoms most days for three weeks or more:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group pb-2">
                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">feeling bloated (a swollen tummy) most of the time</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">feeling full quickly or not wanting to eat much</li>

                            <p>These symptoms can be caused by other things. Most women with these symptoms do not
                            have ovarian cancer. But if you have any of these symptoms, it is important to see your GP.
                            The earlier ovarian cancer is found, the more likely it is that treatment will be successful.</p>

                            <h3 class=awareness>Prostate Cancer Symptoms</h3>
                            <p>Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. You have a higher risk of developing
                            prostate cancer if you are over 50, of African-Caribbean or African origin, or have a father or
                            brother who has had it.</p>
                            <p>Men with early prostate cancer may not have any symptoms. Symptoms only happen when
                            the cancer is large enough to put pressure on the urethra (the tube that carries urine from
                            the bladder). The prostate can also become enlarged due to a condition called benign
                            prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which is not a cancer. The symptoms of BPH and prostate
                            cancer are similar.</p>
                            <p>See your GP if you have any of these symptoms:</p>
                            <ul class="list-group pb-2">

                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">urgently needing to wee</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">needing to wee often, especially at night</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">a feeling of not completely emptying your bladder</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">blood in your wee or semen</li>
                                <li class="list-group-item donListItem">pain when weeing or ejaculating.</li>
                            </ul>

                            them, it is important to see your GP. The earlier prostate cancer is found, the more likely it is
                            to be successfully treated.</p>
                            <p>If you are worried about prostate cancer but don’t have any symptoms, talk to your GP about
                            being examined and doing a PSA test.</p>
