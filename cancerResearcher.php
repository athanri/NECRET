                        <p>Cancer is now the number one killer in Ireland and many other countries around the world. It sadly causes 1 in 4 deaths as cancer incidences continue to rise 1 in 2 people in Ireland will develop cancer during their lifetime. For us, every person is one too many.</p>
                        <p>In continuing to improve cure rates and better outcomes for people with this disease, clinical cancer research will be at the very heart of these efforts.</p>
                        <p>Our researchers can only continue working towards advancing new cancer treatments, if they have funding that they can rely on throughout the different cancer type projects they are studying.</p>
                        <p>NECRET also funds equipment and consumables in addition to salary costs for researchers.</p>
                        <p><strong>Equipment items</strong> includes those designed for specific analysis including Sequenom and  RPPA. Other items include Imaging equipment (microscopes), Electrophoresis equipment and essential lab items i.e.  centrifuges, fridges & freezers, CO2 incubators, cell counter and  pipettes</p>
                        <p><strong>Materials</strong> includes all plastics for cell culture, lab chemicals, kits for PCR experiments and drugs used in toxicity tests.</p>
                        <p>By sponsoring a researcher or scientist, you will be supporting cutting edge cancer research projects be it early stage discovery or research into new treatments.</p>
                        <p>Your support can help support these researchers, to do so please visit  <a href="donate.php">https://necret.ie/donate</a></p>
