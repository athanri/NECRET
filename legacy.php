                        <p>One approach to supporting advances in cancer treatment and care is by leaving a legacy gift in your will towards Necret’s cancer research mission. Any contribution no matter how modest or large will be equally greatly appreciated.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Legacies left to a charity are totally tax free (not subject to inheritance tax), so your gift be it a specific amount of money or a small percentage of your will, can be used towards supporting Necret’s mission of improving the outcomes of people with cancer by advancing cutting edge treatment and care.</p>

                        <h3>Choosing NECRET</h3>
                        <p>Before considering a legacy it is always recommended to ask your solicitor for advice. There are different types of gifts in Wills. Some of the most common ones received by charities are:</p>
                        <p><strong>Residuary Gifts - </strong>A share, or sometimes all, of an estate after all the other payments have been made.</p>
                        <p><strong>Pecuniary Gifts - </strong>A specific sum of money.</p>
                        <p><strong>Specific Gifts - </strong>A particular item, such as property, antiques, jewellery and shares.</p>
                        <h3>Changing Your Existing Will</h3>
                        <p>If you already have a will, it’s easy to amend it to include a gift to NECRET. This change is called a “Codicil” and can be drawn up easily by your solicitor.</p>
                        <h3>Information for your solicitor</h3>
                        <p>If you wish to choose Necret to receive a legacy gift, your solicitor will require our full name, address and charity number.</p>
