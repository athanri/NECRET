                        <h4>Calming Breathing Technique</h4>
                        <p>When we are feeling anxious and stressed a number of physiological changes can occur in our body.</p>
                        <p>We may notice our heart beating fast, we may feel warm and sweaty, our muscles may tighten, we may feel light headed or our body can tremble. Psychologically we may notice our thoughts racing and we can feel overwhelmed.</p>
                        <p>A useful and evidenced based way to counteract these symptoms is to anchor ourselves in the present by focusing our attention on our breathing.</p>
                        <p><strong>Slow paced breathing counteracts these symptoms.</strong> We can slow down our breathing, by breathing deeply and slowly, when we slow our breathing - we slow our heart rate, which in turn calms the body. When the body is calm the mind will follow.</p>
