                                <p class="card-text navyCardText">The physiotherapy service in Haematology and Oncology in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital recently marked it first 6 months.</p>
                                <p class="card-text navyCardText">Started in November 2020 and staffed by Gráinne Kerr, a senior physiotherapist the service offers patients support throughout their cancer journey from diagnosis, through treatment and into survivorship. Physiotherapy can help patients in various areas including exercise tolerance, mobility, strength, flexibility and function. The physiotherapy service also provides rehabilitation after various surgeries including breast care.</p>
                                <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample16">Those who have had surgery or treatment effecting their lymphatic system may also receive physiotherapy specific for lymphoedema. Physiotherapy may also help you to set goals to assist in returning to your usual function, return to work or to assist you in managing side effects from your treatment or disease. As evidence continues to support the role of exercise throughout the cancer continuum, your physiotherapist will assist you to engage in exercise and physical activity in order to achieve many of the associated benefits. To seek a physiotherapy referral, you should have a discussion with your Oncology nurse or doctor.</p>
                                <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample16">Gráinne who previously worked in St James’ Hospital Dublin, the national Cancer Institute for the last 6 years has a Masters in Physiotherapy and a Batchelor of Science in Athletic Therapy and Training. On behalf of everyone in NECRET, we wish Gráinne the very best for the next 6 months and beyond. </p>

                                <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample1">Easier and more effective methods of identifying the virus could only be a positive development as the world seeks to combat it. To that end, NECRET were pleased to support cutting edge research into a new effective, non-invasive test that may increase detection of COVID-19 infection.</p>
                                <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample1">The study, also supported by Science Foundation Ireland and led by Prof. Bryan Hennessy of NECRET and RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences, is published in the current edition of the medical journal Thorax.  The researchers collected breath samples from patients admitted to Beaumont Hospital who tested negative with nasal swab tests but had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. They found that breath samples were able to detect the virus and that testing multiple genes increases detection.</p>
                                <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample1">Further research to bring about a more reliable and a more comfortable test to the nasal swab, which can be an unpleasant experience for people receiving it, is only to be welcomed.</p>

                                CLIMB is a programme for children aged 5-12 who are experiencing the impact of a parent’s cancer diagnosis. CLIMB stands for Children's Lives Include Moments of Bravery. 
                                Pearse has kindly agreed to become NECRET’s first Junior Ambassador. We applaud this wonderful young man.</p>

                                    I normally participate in Necret's largest annual fundraiser in the north-east - the Dip in the Nip. Unfortunately due to Covid-19 restrictions, this year's event was cancelled.
                                    To co-inside with the Winter Solstice, I will be shaving my head for charity at dawn on 21st December 2020, which will be streamed live on my Facebook page.
                                    Christmas can be a demanding time of year financially. But if you could please dig deep and sponsor me if you can, I would be very appreciative.

                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Congratulations to Dr David Easty, Oncology Unit registrar under the guidance of Professor Bryan Hennessy whose research work to improve outcomes for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer has been recognised in the announcement of a nationwide clinical trial being opened.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">NECRET are delighted to be providing funding for the translational part of this trial.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">More details can be found on this study which proposes to test the anti-tumour efficacy of paricalcitol, in combination with GEM/Nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer at the following <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT04617067?cond=paricalcitol&cntry=IE&draw=2&rank=1&view=record" target="_blank">link</a></p>
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">Clinical Trials are now regarded worldwide by cancer experts as the cutting edge in terms of cancer treatment because they not only offer people with cancer the opportunity to get what is currently the best standard treatment, but also to get new drugs that are potentially better than current treatments.</p>
                                    <h3 class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">A New Treatment for Pancreatic cancer:</h3>
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">Pancreatic cancer is sometimes called a difficult to treat cancer. Occasional patients show a good response to chemotherapy and this encourages our efforts to improve current protocols. The incidence is increasing and by 2030 pancreatic cancer will be the second most common cause of death due to cancer. Pancreatic cancer survival rates have remained relatively unchanged since the 1970s and a lot of work is being done to find more effective treatments for this cancer.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">The aim of a new clinical trial is to improve the results of treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. A pair of drugs, called Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel, are widely used to treat patients with pancreatic cancer. We aim to find out whether adding an extra drug, called paricalcitol will improve the results we see with the chemotherapy used today.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">A look under the microscope gives a clue to just why pancreatic cancer is so hard to treat. You can see blue cancer cells sitting round white spaces, but it’s the pink background surrounding the loops of cancer cells which are important. This is especially seen in pancreatic cancer.</p>
                                    <img class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15" src="./img/pc.png" />
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">The body reacts to pancreatic cancer cells by surrounding them with a thick pink scar of tissue and this has been described as like cement. Unfortunately this scar sometimes blocks  chemotherapy from getting into the pancreatic cells. The scar is made by star cells. These are normal cells, but they are traitors that protect the cancer. Not only that, the star cells also feed the cancer cells with amino acids and give it signals to grow. Paricalcitol re-educates the star cells and the hope is this will make chemotherapy more effective.</p>
                                    <p class="card-text navyCardText collapse multi-collapse multiCollapseExample15">The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out whether paricalcitol will further improve the results we get with Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer.</p>
