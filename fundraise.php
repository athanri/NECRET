(Gathering donations is much easier when you’re offering something people want anyway!) If you’re looking to host outside of the workplace, why not tie in with your local book club? Or if you know a friend who is already running a bake sale, remember you can partner up. They can focus on the cake, while you make sure you’ve got the right beans and brew.</li>

Our top tip:  pick a theme. You could focus around the origins of the food you serve or go theme first, food second and serve dishes from your favourite film. Keep in mind the timing of your event, if your hosting in January why not throw a healthy food dinner party to appeal to all those trying to kick bad habits in the new year.</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Dances / Disco</strong> – You don’t need access to a ballroom and moves for Strictly to host a dance (but if you do that’s great) you just need space and music to move to. Will you host your dance at home or will your hire a local venue? We’ve helped lots of supporters raise funds this way so if a disco is how you want to raise money get in touch and let us help you fundraise too.</li>

Raise funds by charging a player fee and why not let spectators donate to take part in a penalty shootout at the end of the match?</li>
                                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Fancy-dress Days</strong> – Fancy dress isn’t just for Halloween. It’s a great way to raise money any time of year. If you’re the boss, why not have your staff come to work in fancy-dress and ask them to pay a small donation for the day? Or if you’re a dab hand on a sewing machine, why not make your own costumes to raise money? Top tip: why not let your colleagues cast votes on the costume you have to wear for the day? They can pay a fee to vote, which will go towards funding vital research (and of course embarrassing you).</li>

But if you have a habit you want to kick, why not do it while fundraising for vital research into cancer? If your habit is costly, why not donate the money you save? Or if your habit causes more frustration to others than yourself, why not have people sponsor you?

It’s a brave way to not only raise money for research but also to raise awareness of cancer.

Or stretch out the activity by giving people the chance to dye your hair a crazy colour for a week before the shave.</li>

You could organise a speed-dating evening or even a full-blown Valentine’s ball. The best part is that even if nobody gets a love match, everyone can go home happy knowing they have supported such an important cause. Don’t have the resource (or friends willing) for a singles event? Why not bake some love themed goodies for the office. Or why not throw an alternative Valentine’s Day event? Whether its fitness or food, make the theme ‘what you love’ and ask for donations from friends who attend.</li>

Got an eye for finding furniture gems online and at car boots? Why not organise your own vintage sale and donate the proceeds to NECRET? If you don’t have enough time to organise your own stall, why not organise a vintage clothes swap? People pay a small fee for entry and you can raise funds on the day with activities and bake sales. Perhaps you could sell homemade lemonade to keep people refreshed while they swap!</li>

So if you can hit the high notes like Mariah, then an X-Factor style competition could be right for you. If you’re not the singer in the group, stick to hosting and if you can’t find the talent to compete, why not host a night and watch the show? You could even put a sweepstake on the show, from who’ll be the first to go to how many times the phrase “I didn’t like it, I loved it” gets used. The prize can be a percentage of the money raised, or a non-monetary prize of your choosing.</li>

Lots of fundraisers use skills they already have to successfully raise money. So if you’re a self-confessed Yogi, why not run a not-for profit class? Your pupils will not only have invested in their own health, but also have the added satisfaction of knowing they’ve made a difference.  You can use our risk assessment templates and information to make sure your yoga event is safe.</li>

What could you do for a year to make a difference? Doing something for 365 days shows ultimate dedication and is a sure way to encourage people to sponsor you. But what to do? How about walking dogs every day for a year and donating the money you make? Or how about giving something up for a whole year?</li>
