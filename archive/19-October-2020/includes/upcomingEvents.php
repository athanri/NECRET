                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Boyne Valley Camino Challenge Registration Open Interested in a fun challenge of an amazing 25km walk and ramble through the beautiful Boyne Valley countryside in aid of NECRET, who support focused activities towards improving treatment and outcomes of people with cancer.</p>  
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Starting from St Peter’s Church led by wonderfully experienced tour leaders who have very kindly volunteered their services, the trail follows the River Boyne before gaining the woodlands of the Townley Estate and then meandering quiet lanes to Mellifont, where there will be an opportunity for that much earned packed lunch or other refreshments. A separate return route gives a total walk of 25km.</p>

                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Not to be deterred by the unfortunate events of this year and on what would remarkably have been our 9th year since the North East Dip in the Nip started, we felt that this memorable occasion should not have to be cancelled or postponed because of Covid restrictions...</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">So We have had to put our thinking caps on and come up with an alternative  to our memorably Dip in the Nip something that both you and your family can safely participate in.</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">So Dippers please keep your fundraising hat on and watch this space!!</p>
                    <p class="card-text navyCardText">Next step - please tag your fellow Dippers here. Some amazing photos and videos of last and previous years Dip Events will be posted soon along with the odd competition.</p>
