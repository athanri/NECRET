This new test which was advanced in collaboration by Dr Rob Smyth under Professor Bryan Hennessy will mean that some cases of lung cancer will be able to be monitored from microscopic breath particles. Lung cancer is the cause of approximately a fifth of all cancer deaths in Ireland and unfortunately the number of cases continues to increase by 3% annually.</p>
