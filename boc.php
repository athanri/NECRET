                        <p>All the Oncology & Haematology Unit Team and NECRET would like to offer their sincerest heartfelt thanks to Geraldineâ€™s Crochet Ladies for the truly beautiful crocheted blankets for the NECRET Blankets of Care appeal. These blankets will now be distributed to patients attending the Unit by the nursing team.</p>
                        <p>It really is a wonderful gesture of care and love by organizer Geraldine Reynolds and her ladies in giving their time, talent and empathy which I am sure will be a source of comfort to those receiving treatment in the Unit. Also big thanks to Gillian McBride of StitchCraft in Dundalk who kindly are sponsoring discounted wool for this appeal.</p>
                        <p>Also special mention to Anna Harbison Egan and Mary McArdle of NECRET for their brilliant efforts with Geraldine in making this come about. If anyone is interested in donating their time to help, please DM Geraldine on her <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mrsgeraldinereynolds">Facebook Page</a></p>
