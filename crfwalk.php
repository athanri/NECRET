                        <p>Not to missed - a really lovely morning around the beautiful rolling countryside of the Naul this wonderful walk in memory of Celine Reilly Flynn takes place in early October each year.</p>
                        <p>Organised by Celineâ€™s family and friends it starts from the Naul Village at 10.00am with the route option being 5km or 8km. Refreshments provided afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Celine Reilly Flynn was born and raised in Naul Village in County Dublin. At a very young age in April 2016 Celine was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. During her treatment Celine committed herself to raising funds and awareness for a Charity very close to her heart, NECRET (North East Cancer Research & Education Trust) who support the Oncology Unit, in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately after a brave and courageous battle Celine lost her fight in July 2017 and we are carrying on her wish in fundraising for this Charity to help fight Cancer.</p>
                        <p>The walk beginning from the Naul square always has some fun pre-race activities including a warm-up which has become legendary, delivered local members of the Dublin ladies All Ireland Winning Team. The day finishes with refreshments provided in the Seamus Ennis Arts Centre and a really fabulous raffle to close the day. </p>
                        <p>NECRET are greatly appreciative of the incredible support shown by  Celine before her sad passing  and her family and friends who have continued do so over many years.</p>
